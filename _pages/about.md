I am currently a sofware engineer in Google. Previously I received my Ph.D. degree in the Electrical Computer Engineering Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara, advised by [Prof.Yuan Xie](https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/~yuanxie/). I was a member of the [Scalable Energy Efficiency Architecture Lab (SEAL)](https://seal.ece.ucsb.edu/). My Ph.D. study focuses on near-data-processing / process-in-memory (NDP/PIM) architecture, memory sub-system, and domain-specific accelerator design. I maintain [a list of PIM/NDP papers](https://github.com/miglopst/PIM_NDP_papers) for researchers who are interested in this domain. I received my B.S. degree in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University.
